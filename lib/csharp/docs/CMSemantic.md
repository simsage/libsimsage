A SimSAge semantic.  A semantic is an 'is-a' relationship.  A generalization/specialization relationship.  The 'word' (the more specialized part) is the primary-key/id of this relationship.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Word** | **string** | The word of a semantic is the more specific concept (eg. in &#39;John is a person&#39;, then &#39;John&#39; is the more specific concept, and &#39;person&#39; is the semantic). | 
**Semantic** | **string** | The semantic is the more general concept (eg. in &#39;John is a person&#39;, &#39;person&#39; is the more general concept, and &#39;John&#39; is more specific). |
