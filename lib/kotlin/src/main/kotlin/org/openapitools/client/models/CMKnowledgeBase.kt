/**
 * A knowledge-base is SimSage's representation of a list of information silos belonging to an organisation.  A knowledge-base represents a second level of isolation between data in SimSage.  The first level is an Organisation.  Each organisation in SimSage has a list of knowledge-bases, strictly isolated from each other.  Each knowledge-base in turn can have many sources (information collectors that add items to a knowledge-base like a file-crawler, or a web-crawler)
 *
 * @param organisationId the main organisation (its guid id)
 * @param kbId the knowledge-base id (its guid id)
 * @param name the name of this knowledge-base (must be unique within an organisation)
 * @param email the support email of the person to email with any UI generated questions
 * @param securityId the security id (a guid) of this knowledge-base.  This is a shared secret between SimSage and external systems.
 * @param created when this knowledge-base was created, a unix date-time long
 * @param maxQueriesPerDay limit the number of queries per day (if greater than 0).  A value of zero (0) indicates no limits.
 * @param analyticsWindowInMonths How long to keep analytics for in months.  A value of zero (0) indicates forever
 * @param enabled a flag signalling this knowledge-base is active (can be used).  An inactive knowledge-base cannot be queried.
 * @param operatorEnabled a flag signalling this knowledge-base has operator support.  A value of false prevents this knowledge-base's operator from interacting with end-users.
 * @param capacityWarnings All queries are given a 10% grace when daily-limits (maxQueriesPerDay) are enforced.  If this flag is true, the owner of this knowledge-base (email) is sent a warning at 100% daily utiliziation.
 * @param indexSchedule the time-schedule for index-optimization, when active.
 * @param lastIndexOptimizationTime the last time this triggered and ran as a unix date-time (read only)
 * @param isOptimizing is the index optimizer active?
 * @param optimizationProgress how far along is the optimizer if it is active (0% to 100%)
 * @param optimizing
