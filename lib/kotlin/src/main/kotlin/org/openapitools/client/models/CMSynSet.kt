 * A SynSet is an ambiguous noun.  A SynSet tells SimSage how to distinguish between different homoglyphs (same word) with different meanings.

 * @param word the word that makes a synset group (an ambiguous noun language concept) (eg. 'bank')
 * @param lemma the lemma of this word (ie. the simplified base, usually the same as the word, but the lemma of 'banks' is 'bank')
 * @param wordCloudCsvList A list of word-clouds that form each distinct synset.  Each string in this variable is itself a csv string.  The first word of this cloud forms the distinct marker of the synset.
