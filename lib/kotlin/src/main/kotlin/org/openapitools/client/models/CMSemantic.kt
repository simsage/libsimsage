 * A SimSAge semantic.  A semantic is an 'is-a' relationship.  A generalization/specialization relationship.  The 'word' (the more specialized part) is the primary-key/id of this relationship.

 * @param word The word of a semantic is the more specific concept (eg. in 'John is a person', then 'John' is the more specific concept, and 'person' is the semantic).
 * @param semantic The semantic is the more general concept (eg. in 'John is a person', 'person' is the more general concept, and 'John' is more specific).
