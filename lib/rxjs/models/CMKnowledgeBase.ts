/**
 * A knowledge-base is SimSage\'s representation of a list of information silos belonging to an organisation.  A knowledge-base represents a second level of isolation between data in SimSage.  The first level is an Organisation.  Each organisation in SimSage has a list of knowledge-bases, strictly isolated from each other.  Each knowledge-base in turn can have many sources (information collectors that add items to a knowledge-base like a file-crawler, or a web-crawler)
